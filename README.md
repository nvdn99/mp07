3.1 Create New Car File

Users can create a new text file associated with a car. They provide a file name, and the system generates an empty text file for further editing.

3.2 View Selected Car File

The system displays the content of the selected car's text file. Users can view details and perform various operations on the file.

3.3 Edit Car File

Users have the option to edit the content of the selected car's text file. The application provides a text area for making changes.

3.4 Save Changes

After editing, users can save the changes made to the car's text file. The updated content is then stored in the system.
