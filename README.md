# Car Management System

This repository contains a full-stack Car Management application built with Express.js and React. The application allows users to add new cars to a MongoDB database and view the list of existing cars.

Add a Car: Users can input details such as model, year, and color to add a new car to the database.
Display Cars: The application provides a list of cars, displaying their model, year, and color.


# Backend (Express.js)

Technologies Used:
Express.js
MongoDB (Atlas Cloud)

Server Setup (Express):
You use Express.js as the backend framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.

MongoDB Connection:
Connect to a MongoDB database using the MongoDB Node.js driver.
The MongoDB connection URI is stored in the uri variable, which should ideally be kept in environment variables for security.

Middleware Setup:
Set up middleware for handling CORS to allow cross-origin resource sharing.
Use express.urlencoded and express.json middleware to parse incoming requests with URL-encoded and JSON payloads.

API Versioning:
Implement API versioning by creating a router (v1Router) that handles routes with the /v1 prefix.
Define routes for adding a car (/v1/add) and retrieving all cars (/v1/api/cars).

Logging Middleware:
Implement a logging middleware to log each incoming request method and URL.
Home Page Rendering:
Set up a basic home page at the root (/) that provides links to the car operations.

Car Operations:
Render a form to add a new car at /v1/add.
Handle POST requests to add a new car to the database.
Handle GET requests to retrieve all cars from the database.

Server Start:
Start the Express server, listening on a specified port (in this case, 3002).

# Frontend (React.js)

Technologies Used:
Server-side:
Express.js
MongoDB
CORS
Client-side:
React

React Components:
Create functional React components for the frontend views:
App: The main component that renders the entire application.
CarForm: Renders a form for adding a new car.
CarList: Renders the list of cars.

State Management:
Use React useState to manage the state of the application.
Maintain a state variable (cars) to store the list of cars.

Effect Hook (useEffect):
Utilize the useEffect hook to fetch the list of cars from the server when the component mounts.
Update the cars state with the fetched data.

Form Handling:
Implement a form in the CarForm component to input details like model, year, and color.
Use the useState hook to manage form input state.
Implement a function (handleAddCar) to handle the submission of the form, sending a POST request to the server.

Fetching Data:
Use the fetch API to make a GET request to the server to retrieve the list of cars.
Handle the fetched data and update the cars state.

Adding a Car:
Implement a function (handleAddCar) to handle the addition of a new car.
Use the fetch API to make a POST request to the server to add a new car to the database.
Update the cars state with the new car.

Styling:
Apply basic styling to the components using CSS to create a visually appealing interface.

Error Handling:
Implement error handling for both data fetching and form submission to provide feedback to the user in case of errors.

Loading Indicators:
Consider adding loading indicators to provide feedback to the user during data fetching.

Environment Configuration:
Ensure the client-side code knows the correct API endpoint. In your case, it's set to 'https://mniprojectback7.onrender.com/v1/api/cars'. Update it if your server is hosted elsewhere.

# Usage
